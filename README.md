# Auto MPG Predictor

## Part 1: Model Training and Testing

This project is a machine learning application that predicts the miles per gallon (MPG) for automobiles based on various features. It's developed as a learning exercise and currently consists of two main parts: model training and model testing.

### Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Model serialization and deserialization
- Comprehensive unit tests for the prediction functionality

### How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries (pandas, scikit-learn).
2. To train the model:
   ```
   python src/train.py
   ```
3. To run the tests:
   ```
   python src/test_predict.py
   ```

### Next Steps

This project is part of a larger learning journey. The upcoming phases will include:

1. **API Development**: Creating a RESTful API to serve predictions.
2. **Frontend Development**: Building a user-friendly web interface to interact with the model.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to expand this project!
